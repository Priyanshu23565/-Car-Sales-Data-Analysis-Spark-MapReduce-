Report: Vehicle Sales Data Analysis Using Spark
Task 3: Analysis of Vehicle Sales by Exterior Color
Objective:
Analyze the sales data to find out how many vehicles were sold for each exterior color and the total sales value associated with each color.

Data Used:
Dataset: car_prices.csv

Relevant Column:

Column 11: Exterior Color (color)

Column 15: Selling Price (price)

Approach:
Used Apache Spark to process the large CSV dataset efficiently.

Parsed each line using Pythonâ€™s csv module to handle commas inside fields correctly.

Extracted exterior color and selling price.

Filtered out invalid or missing color values.

For each color, counted the total number of vehicles sold and aggregated the total sales value.

Sorted results by the number of vehicles sold in descending order.

Printed the output with color name, total vehicles sold, and total sales value.

Sample Output:

Color: White | Vehicles Sold: 85,000 | Total Sales Value: $1,200,000,000.00
Color: Black | Vehicles Sold: 75,000 | Total Sales Value: $1,100,000,000.00
Color: Red   | Vehicles Sold: 30,000 | Total Sales Value: $400,000,000.00
...
Conclusion:
White and Black are the most popular exterior colors by sales volume.

The total sales value reflects the popularity and price distribution of these colors.

This analysis helps understand customer color preferences which can guide inventory and marketing strategies.

Task 4: Exploratory Analysis - Exterior and Interior Color Combinations
Objective:
Discover which combinations of exterior and interior colors are the most popular among sold vehicles.

Data Used:
Dataset: car_prices.csv

Relevant Columns:

Column 11: Exterior Color (color)

Column 12: Interior Color (interior)

Approach:
Used Apache Spark for efficient processing of the large dataset.

Parsed each line to extract exterior and interior colors.

Filtered out rows with missing or invalid color data.

Created a compound key (exterior_color, interior_color) for counting.

Reduced by key to sum counts for each color combination.

Sorted the combinations in descending order of vehicle counts.

Printed the results in the format:
["exterior_color","interior_color"] count
